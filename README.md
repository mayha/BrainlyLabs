BrainlyLabs
===========

Some examples from Tests, written for mobile Apps (from Brainly group).
The test are written for #4 KraQA meetup: "Appium - mobile test automation".
The code above is the sample test written in python to communicate with appium server and perform user actions on Android Device.


I cannot published my .apk package, so my instruction how to run it is useless.

All you can see here is the sample test code in python: please see the **NewAddTaskTest.py** for test code, and **__init__.py** in xpath directory for the dictionary of xpath's to UI elements.
